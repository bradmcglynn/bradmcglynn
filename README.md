Hi, I’m @bradmcglynn. Currently working towards a BSc in Computer Science, aiming to land a role in the data science/ data analytics field.

I’m interested in all things data related: artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analysis, etc

I’m currently learning machine learning & AI fundamentals, utilizing Python to reinforce the core concepts.

I’m looking to collaborate on artificial intelligence projects, data analytic projects, or sports analytic projects

How to reach me ...
